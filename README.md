# SIEM Implementation Portfolio: Wazuh Deployment

## Challenge
The organization lacked centralized security event monitoring, resulting in limited visibility into security activity, delayed threat detection, and challenges meeting compliance and audit requirements.



## Solution Overview
I designed and implemented a distributed **Wazuh SIEM** deployment to provide centralized logging, monitoring, and alerting using an open-source, cost-effective solution.

### SIEM Architecture & Deployment
- Deployed a distributed Wazuh architecture consisting of a central manager, indexer, and dashboard components  
- Integrated multiple data sources, including endpoints and system logs, to establish centralized visibility  
- Configured secure agent-to-manager communication and log ingestion  

### Detection & Alerting
- Implemented custom alert rules to detect security-relevant events and anomalous behavior  
- Tuned alert severity to reduce noise and prioritize actionable findings  
- Configured automated notifications to accelerate incident awareness and response  

### Monitoring & Visibility
- Built dashboards to visualize security events, trends, and system health  
- Enabled compliance-related monitoring to improve audit and regulatory visibility  
- Established baseline activity to support faster identification of deviations  



## Impact
- Improved threat detection and response times through centralized monitoring  
- Enhanced visibility into security events across the environment  
- Increased compliance and audit readiness through structured logging and reporting  
- Reduced mean time to detect (MTTD) and respond to incidents  
- Improved operational awareness of security activity  



## Key Takeaways
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Design and implement centralized monitoring and SIEM solutions  
- Effectively leverage open-source security tools  
- Improve security posture without reliance on high-cost platforms  
- Translate technical implementations into measurable security and business impact
