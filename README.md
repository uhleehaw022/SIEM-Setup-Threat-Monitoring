# SIEM Implementation Portfolio: Wazuh Deployment

## Challenge
Organizations lacked centralized monitoring for security events, resulting in delayed threat detection and limited visibility into compliance posture.

## Solution
- Implemented a **distributed Wazuh deployment** to provide centralized logging, monitoring, and alerting — using an open-source, cost-effective solution.
- Configured alerts, dashboards, and automated notifications to streamline security operations.

## Impact
- Faster threat detection and response
- Improved compliance visibility
- Measurable reduction in incident response times
- Enhanced operational awareness of security events

## Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Design and implement centralized monitoring solutions
- Utilize open-source SIEM tools effectively
- Improve organizational security posture without high-cost solutions
- Translate technical deployments into measurable business impact
